# Info 
Based off of EasyBot.py, SimpleBot.py is a simpler way to deploy your bot. You can just literally control everything with one file, which is the `manage.py` file. This is a much simpler way to control your bot, and well, it does a great job at it. SimpleBot is also highly modular and customizable. You can include Cogs that you would like, and remove other ones that you don't really like. And you can go ahead and make your own.
